# Support Credit Earning Rule

## INTENT
To implement support credit earning where damage mitigation (blocking, shielding) earns credits for the support player, and status effects provide flat credit rewards based on skill power.

## THE RULE / LOGIC
**Damage Mitigation Credits:**
- 1 HP mitigated = 1 credit earned
- Applies to shields, damage reduction, and other mitigation
- Credits go to the effect caster, not the shielded character

**Effect Caster Tracking:**
- All effects must track CasterID until effect ends
- Shields continue earning credits for caster even if caster dies
- Enables proper credit assignment for support play

**Status Effect Credits (Flat Rate):**
- Poison/Stun/Buff: SkillWeight/10 credits per application
- Example: 100 SW poison skill = 10 credits per poison application
- Credits awarded at moment of effect application, not per-turn
- Supports support playstyles and status effect users

**Credit Assignment Logic:**
```go
// When shield blocks damage
if shield.BlocksDamage > 0 {
    credits.Earned += shield.BlocksDamage
    credits.AssignedTo = shield.CasterID  // Original caster
}
```
